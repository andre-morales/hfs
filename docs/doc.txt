+ IE4- No functionality beyond downloading and maybe uploading trough forms. Disabled JS. Browsers from the IE4 era don't really support standard DOM functionality and polyfilling for them would be a pain.
+ IE5+ No jQuery. Menus will work and editing functionality should work acceptably.
+ IE6+ jQuery. Polyfill for fancy sliders and UI available.
+ IE9+ HTML video with custom controls.
+ IE11 HTML video with subtitles.

-- IE5 --
+ element.className
+ element.parentNode
+ element.getElementById()
+ element.removeChild()
+ element.attachEvent()
